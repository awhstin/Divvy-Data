# Divvy-Data-Viz

Here is a walk-through of the Divvy Bike data in Chicago. The datasets imported are broken up by quarter in the year 2015.

See my blog post on the whole process [here](http://www.austinwehrwein.com/data-visualization/divvy-bike-data/)

There is more data shared by Divvy if you follow [these blue words](https://www.divvybikes.com/data).

This is the shapefile map I use to plot
